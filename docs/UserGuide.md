# SummonersBook User Guide

SummonersBook is a **desktop app for esports players (League of Legends)**, optimized for a fast **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still providing clear visual feedback via a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SummonersBook helps you manage players and form balanced teams faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest `summonersbook.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08b-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `add n/Faker rk/Grandmaster rl/Bottom c/Sivir` — Adds a new player with a specified rank, role and champion.
    * `find rl/Support` — Filters the player list based on the role "Support".
    * `group` — Auto-creates balanced 5-player teams from unassigned players.
    * `viewteam 1` — Shows full details of the 1st team.
    * `exit` — Exits the app. 

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME rk/RANK rl/ROLE c/CHAMPION`, `NAME` , `RANK`, `ROLE`, `CHAMPION` are parameters which can be used as `add n/Faker rk/Grandmaster rl/Bottom c/Sivir`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g., `find [n/NAME] [rl/ROLE] [rk/RANK] [c/CHAMPION]` can be used as `find rk/Gold`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g., for `add n/NAME rk/RANK rl/ROLE c/CHAMPION`, `add rk/RANK n/NAME rl/ROLE c/CHAMPION` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Indices refer to the **currently displayed** list (players or teams), starting from 1.
 
* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
