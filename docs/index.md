**SummonersBook is a desktop application for managing your champion builds and summoner profiles.**
While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen through a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* If you are interested in using SummonersBook, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing SummonersBook, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
