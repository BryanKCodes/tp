## **Setting up, getting started**

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [
`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08b-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [
`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08b-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in
charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API
  `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [
`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08b-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [
`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08b-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in [
`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08b-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [
`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08b-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API
call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of
PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates
   a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which
   is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take
   several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a
  `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [
`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08b-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a
  `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores all `Team` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTeamList` object).
* provides a list of unassigned persons required for team formation commands like group.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative, and arguably more object-oriented, model is presented below. This design utilizes the **Flyweight design pattern** to efficiently handle shared data. In this model, the `AddressBook` contains unique lists of `Tag`s, `Champion`s, `Role`s, and `Rank`s. Each `Person` object then simply **references** these shared attributes as needed. This approach is far more efficient as it ensures that only one object is created for each unique attribute. For example, instead of every `Person` with the "Support" role maintaining their own duplicate `Role` object, they all point to a single, shared instance managed by the `AddressBook`. This design promotes better data management, ensures consistency, and significantly reduces redundancy and memory usage within the application.

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

### Storage component

**API** : [
`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08b-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Filter Feature

#### Implementation

The filter feature is implemented through the `FilterCommand` and `FilterPredicate` classes.
It allows users to display only the persons whose attributes match the given criteria — such as role, rank, champion
and average score greater than a threshold.

When the user executes a command such as:

`filter rk/Gold rl/Mid s/0.5`

the app filters the list of persons based on the provided criteria.
In this example, the result will include all persons whose **rank** is Gold **and** whose **role** is Mid
**and** whose **average score** is greater than or equal **0.5**.

This functionality is supported by three key components:

- **`FilterCommand`** — represents the command that performs filtering.
- **`FilterPredicate`** classes — encapsulates the logical conditions for filtering.
  - `ChampionContainsKeywordsPredicate` — condition for matching champion
  - `RankContainsKeywordsPredicate` — condition for matching rank
  - `RoleContainsKetwordsPredicate` — condition for matching role
  - `ScoreInRangePredicate` — condition for comparing the average score
- **`Model#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person>)`** — applies the predicate to the main person list, updating the UI display.

Each field type (rank, role, champion) within the same category uses **OR** logic:
> Example: `filter rk/Gold rk/Silver` → persons with rank Gold **or** Silver.

Across different field types, conditions are combined using **AND** logic:
> Example: `filter rk/Gold rk/Silver rl/Mid` → persons who are (Gold **or** Silver) **and** play Mid.

---

#### Example Usage

**Step 1.**
When the app starts, all persons are displayed.
No filtering has been applied yet.

---

**Step 2.**
The user executes `filter rk/Gold`.
The `FilterCommandParser` creates a `FilterCommand` containing a `FilterPredicate` that checks each person’s rank.
`Model#updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)` is called, and the UI updates to show only matching entries.

---

**Step 3.**
The user then runs `filter rk/Gold rl/Mid`.
Now, the displayed list includes only persons whose rank is Gold **and** whose role is Mid.

---

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:**
The `list` command can be used to reset the view and display everyone.

</box>

---

#### Sequence of Operation

The following sequence diagram illustrates how a filter command flows through the app:

<puml src="diagrams/FilterCommandExecutionSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="FilterCommandExecutionSequenceDiagram" />

<puml src="diagrams/FilterCommandParserSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="FilterCommandParserSequenceDiagram" />

---

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How filtering is executed**

- **Alternative 1 (current implementation):**
  Apply filtering by setting a predicate using `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)`.
    - *Pros:* Simple and efficient. Leverages JavaFX’s built-in `FilteredList`.
    - *Cons:* Each new filter replaces the previous one.

- **Alternative 2:**
  Maintain a list of active filters that are combined dynamically.
    - *Pros:* Enables cumulative filtering (e.g. filter by role, then by rank later).
    - *Cons:* Adds complexity and state management overhead.

### AddStats

#### Implementation
The **add stats** feature is implemented with three components:

- **`AddStatsCommand`** — applies the update to the selected `Person`.
- **`AddStatsCommandParser`** — parses user input like `addStats 1 cpm/9.9 gd15/2000 kda/3.5`.
- **`Stats#addLatestStats(String cpm, String gd15, String kda)`** — validates inputs and returns a **new** `Stats` with one additional record (immutability).

When a user runs:

`addStats 1 cpm/9.9 gd15/2000 kda/3.5`

1. `AddStatsCommandParser` tokenizes arguments, extracts the **index** and the prefixed fields `cpm/`, `gd15/`, and `kda/`.  
   Missing fields, duplicate unrelated prefixes, or malformed indices cause a `ParseException`
   with `AddStatsCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE`.

2. `AddStatsCommand#execute(model)`:
    - Retrieves the target `Person` from `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`.
    - Calls `person.getStats().addLatestStats(cpm, gd15, kda)`, which:
        - Validates with regex and ranges (CPM ∈ `[0,40]`, KDA ∈ `[0,200]` allowing up to **2** decimal places; GD15 ∈ `[-10000,10000]`).
        - Computes a per-match **score** using normalized CPM/KDA and a logistic transform of GD15.
        - Returns a **new** `Stats` whose lists are appended and average (1 d.p.) recomputed.
    - Builds a new `Person` (preserving id/name/role/rank/champion/tags/wins/losses) with the **updated `Stats`**.
    - If the person is in a team, constructs an updated `Team` with that member replaced and calls `model.setTeam(old, updated)`.  
      Otherwise only `model.setPerson(old, updated)` is invoked.
    - Refreshes UI lists via `updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS)` and `updateFilteredTeamList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_TEAMS)` and returns a `CommandResult`.

<box type="info" seamless>
`Stats` is **immutable in its API**: callers receive a fresh instance; original lists are not mutated.
</box>

---

#### Example Usage

**Step 1.**  
User runs `addStats 1 cpm/10.2 gd15/2400 kda/2.6`.  
The parser creates `AddStatsCommand(Index.fromOneBased(1), "10.2", "2400", "2.6")`.

---

**Step 2.**  
`AddStatsCommand#execute(model)` reads the selected person, calls `Stats#addLatestStats(...)`, and obtains a new `Stats` with one more record and a new average.

---

**Step 3.**  
If the person belongs to a team, that team is rebuilt with the edited person and saved back to the model.  
The command reports success using `AddStatsCommand.MESSAGE_RECORD_SUCCESS`.

---

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Where to validate the stats values**

- **Alternative 1 (current):** Validate inside the domain (`Stats#isValidStats` and checks in `addLatestStats`).
    - *Pros:* Single source of truth; reusable; `Command` stays thin.
    - *Cons:* `IllegalArgumentException` must be surfaced as a user-facing error.

- **Alternative 2:** Validate fully in the parser.
    - *Pros:* Earliest feedback; `Command` never sees bad inputs.
    - *Cons:* Duplicates rules if other features (e.g., imports) also add stats.

**Aspect: Keeping team rosters consistent**

- **Alternative 1 (current):** If edited person is in a team, rebuild and save the team with the updated member.
    - *Pros:* Team view and data remain consistent.
    - *Cons:* Extra lookup and update per command.

- **Alternative 2:** Update only the person list and let team lists refresh indirectly.
    - *Pros:* Simpler update path.
    - *Cons:* Risk of stale team membership if teams store copies.

---

### Delete Stats Feature

#### Implementation

The **delete stats** feature removes the most recent (last) statistics entry from a player’s history while
keeping the rest of the model consistent.

It is implemented with three components:

- **`DeleteStatsCommand`** — performs the deletion on the selected `Person` (by index).
- **`DeleteStatsCommandParser`** — parses user input like `deleteStats 1`.
- **`Stats#deleteLatestStats()`** — returns a **new** `Stats` with the last entry removed, or throws a
  `CommandException` when the history is empty.

When a user runs:

`deleteStats 1`

1. `DeleteStatsCommandParser` parses the **index** from the preamble.  
   If the index is missing/invalid, it throws a `ParseException` with
   `DeleteStatsCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE`.

2. `DeleteStatsCommand#execute(model)`:
    - Retrieves the target `Person` from `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`.
    - Calls `person.getStats().deleteLatestStats()` which:
        - Ensures there is at least one record; otherwise throws `CommandException`
          with `Stats.NOT_DELETED_MESSAGE`.
        - Produces a **new** `Stats` snapshot with the last CPM/GD15/KDA/score removed and the average recomputed.
    - Builds a new `Person` (preserving id/name/role/rank/champion/tags/wins/losses) with the updated `Stats`.
    - If the person is in a team, constructs an updated `Team` that replaces the old member with the edited one,
      then calls `model.setTeam(old, updated)`. Otherwise only `model.setPerson(old, updated)` is called.
    - Refreshes lists via `updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS)` and
      `updateFilteredTeamList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_TEAMS)`, and returns a `CommandResult`.

<box type="info" seamless>
`Stats` follows an immutable-API pattern. Deletion never mutates in-place; a fresh instance is returned and
stored on the edited `Person`.
</box>

---

#### Example Usage

**Step 1.**  
User runs `deleteStats 1`. The parser creates `DeleteStatsCommand(Index.fromOneBased(1))`.

---

**Step 2.**  
`DeleteStatsCommand#execute(model)` retrieves the selected person, calls `Stats#deleteLatestStats()`,
and receives a new `Stats` with one fewer entry and a recalculated average.

---

**Step 3.**  
If the person belongs to a team, the team is rebuilt with the edited person and persisted in the model.
The command reports success using `DeleteStatsCommand.MESSAGE_RECORD_SUCCESS`.

---

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Behavior when there is no history to delete**

- **Alternative 1 (current):** Throw `CommandException` from `Stats#deleteLatestStats()` with a clear
  message (e.g., “This player has no statistics record to be deleted”).
    - *Pros:* Explicit feedback; prevents silent no-op; keeps rule centralized in the domain.
    - *Cons:* Command must catch/propagate a domain exception.

- **Alternative 2:** Interpret as a no-op and still return success.
    - *Pros:* Simpler flow for callers.
    - *Cons:* Confusing to users; hides data errors (e.g., attempting to delete when nothing exists).

**Aspect: Consistency with team rosters**

- **Alternative 1 (current):** When a member’s stats change, rebuild and persist the containing team as well.
    - *Pros:* UI and persistence always reflect the edited member consistently.
    - *Cons:* Slightly more work per command.

- **Alternative 2:** Update only the person list and rely on indirect refresh.
    - *Pros:* Fewer writes.
    - *Cons:* Risk of stale team state if teams hold copies.

---

### Auto-Grouping Feature

#### Implementation

The auto-grouping feature is implemented through the `GroupCommand`, `GroupCommandParser`, and `TeamMatcher` classes.
It automatically creates rank-ordered teams from all unassigned persons, taking into account **person roles, ranks, and champions**.

When the user executes:

`group`

the application attempts to form as many full teams as possible while respecting role requirements (Top, Jungle, Mid, ADC, Support) and avoiding duplicate champions within the same team.

This functionality is supported by the following key components:

- **`GroupCommand`** — represents the command that performs auto-grouping. Validates input and orchestrates team formation.
- **`GroupCommandParser`** — parses user input for the group command. Ensures no arguments are provided.
- **`TeamMatcher`** — contains the core algorithm for forming rank-ordered teams from unassigned persons.
- **`Model#getUnassignedPersonList()`** — retrieves the list of persons not currently assigned to any team.
- **`Model#addTeam(Team)`** — adds newly formed teams to the model and updates the UI.

---

#### TeamMatcher Algorithm

The `TeamMatcher` class implements a sophisticated role-based matching algorithm:

1. **Group by Role**: All unassigned persons are grouped by their roles (Top, Jungle, Mid, ADC, Support).

2. **Sort by Rank**: Within each role group, persons are sorted by rank in descending order (highest to lowest). This uses the `Rank` class's natural `Comparable` ordering.

3. **Iterative Team Formation**:
   - The algorithm attempts to form teams by selecting one person from each role.
   - For each role, it selects the highest-ranked available person who doesn't have a champion conflict.
   - A champion conflict occurs when a person plays the same champion as someone already selected for the current team.

4. **Champion Conflict Resolution**:
   - If the highest-ranked person for a role has a champion conflict, the algorithm tries the next person in that role.
   - If no person can be found without a conflict, team formation stops.

5. **Continuation**: The algorithm continues forming teams until it cannot form a complete team of 5 persons.

The key methods implementing this logic are `TeamMatcher#formTeams()` and `TeamMatcher#selectPersonWithoutChampionConflict()`.

---

#### Sequence Diagrams

The execution of the `group` command involves complex logic for team formation, including several success and failure paths. To ensure clarity and avoid an overly complex diagram, the logic is presented in two distinct scenarios: one that covers successful team formation and another that details the initial failure conditions.

##### Scenario 1: Successful Team Formation

This diagram illustrates the "happy path" where at least one team is successfully formed. It assumes the initial validation for minimum required roles passes. The flow shows how the `TeamMatcher` algorithm iteratively builds teams and also correctly models how the process stops gracefully if it can no longer form a complete team (e.g., due to a champion conflict on a subsequent attempt).

<puml src="diagrams/GroupCommandSuccessSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="GroupCommandSuccessSequenceDiagram" />

##### Scenario 2: Failure to Form Any Teams

This diagram focuses exclusively on the critical failure paths that prevent any teams from being formed. Using an `alt` fragment, it shows the two mutually exclusive failure modes:
1.  **`[missing persons for one or more roles]`**: The process fails during the initial validation and throws a `MissingRolesException`.
2.  **`[sufficient persons for all roles]`**: The validation passes, but an unresolvable `DuplicateChampionException` occurs during the formation of the very first team.

<puml src="diagrams/GroupCommandFailureSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="GroupCommandFailureSequenceDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The diagrams show the flow for a successful team formation. Error cases (e.g., insufficient persons) would result in a `CommandException` being thrown from `GroupCommand` before reaching `TeamMatcher`.

</box>

---

#### Example Usage

**Step 1.**
The user has a list of unassigned persons with various roles and ranks.
The application currently shows all persons without any teams assigned.

**Step 2.**
The user executes the `group` command.
- `GroupCommandParser` validates that no arguments were provided.
- `GroupCommand` is created and executed.
- `GroupCommand#execute()` fetches all unassigned persons via `Model#getUnassignedPersonList()`.

**Step 3.**
`TeamMatcher#matchTeams()` is called to form rank-ordered teams:
- Persons are grouped by role.
- Each role group is sorted by rank (highest to lowest).
- Teams are formed iteratively by selecting the highest-ranked available person from each role while avoiding champion conflicts.
- This creates rank-ordered teams where Team 1 contains the highest-ranked persons, Team 2 contains the next-highest-ranked persons, and so on.

**Step 4.**
Teams are successfully formed according to role, rank, and champion constraints.
`Model#addTeam(team)` is called for each team, updating the application state and UI.
A success message shows the number of teams created and remaining unassigned persons.

---

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:**
If there are insufficient persons to form a full team (i.e., missing a required role), the command will throw a `CommandException` with:

`No teams could be formed. Ensure there is at least one unassigned person for each role (Top, Jungle, Mid, ADC, Support).`

Any leftover unassigned persons remain in the pool and can be used in future auto-grouping operations.

</box>

---

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Team formation algorithm**

- **Alternative 1 (current implementation):**
  Uses a greedy algorithm that prioritizes rank within each role and checks for champion conflicts.
    - *Pros:* Simple, predictable, and efficient (O(n log n) for sorting + O(n) for team formation).
    - *Pros:* Creates consistent rank-ordered teams where Team 1 gets the highest-ranked players, Team 2 gets the next-highest-ranked players, etc. This is useful for organizing scrimmages by skill level.
    - *Cons:* May not find an optimal solution if champion conflicts are complex. The algorithm stops when it cannot form a complete team, even if rearranging persons might allow more teams.

- **Alternative 2:**
  Use a backtracking algorithm to explore all possible team combinations and find the maximum number of teams.
    - *Pros:* Guarantees finding the optimal solution (maximum number of teams).
    - *Cons:* Exponential time complexity (O(n!)). Impractical for large person lists.
    - *Cons:* Overly complex for the use case. Coaches can manually adjust teams if needed.

- **Alternative 3:**
  Use a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) solver.
    - *Pros:* Can handle complex constraints elegantly.
    - *Cons:* Requires external library and adds significant complexity.
    - *Cons:* Overkill for this domain where greedy approach works well.

### Viewing Person Details Feature

#### Implementation

The person details viewing feature is implemented through the `ViewCommand`, `ViewCommandParser`, `PersonDetailWindow`, and enhanced `CommandResult` classes.
It allows users to view comprehensive information about a person in a dedicated modal window, including performance statistics visualized with JavaFX charts.

When the user executes:

`view INDEX`

the application opens a new window displaying the person's details, win/loss record, and performance trends over their last 10 matches.

This functionality is supported by the following key components:

- **`ViewCommand`** — represents the command that retrieves a person by index and triggers the detail window.
- **`ViewCommandParser`** — parses the user input and validates the index format.
- **`CommandResult`** — encapsulates the command result and signals to the UI that a person detail window should be shown. Uses the factory method `CommandResult.showPersonDetail()`.
- **`PersonDetailWindow`** — the JavaFX controller that manages the modal window displaying person details and performance charts.
- **`MainWindow#handlePersonDetail()`** — the UI event handler that creates and shows the `PersonDetailWindow` when triggered by a `CommandResult`.

---

#### Architecture and Design Pattern

The `PersonDetailWindow` follows a **hybrid declarative-imperative UI pattern**:

1. **Declarative FXML Structure**: The window's layout, labels, and chart components are defined in `PersonDetailWindow.fxml`. This separates presentation from logic (Separation of Concerns principle).

2. **Imperative Data Binding**: The Java controller (`PersonDetailWindow.java`) populates the FXML components with data from the `Person` object through the `setPerson()` method.

3. **Dynamic Chart Population**: Performance charts are dynamically populated with data series through private helper methods that transform `Stats` data into JavaFX `XYChart.Series`.

This design is pragmatic and maintainable: static structure is in FXML (easy to modify layouts), while dynamic data binding is in Java (type-safe and testable).

**Key methods**:
- `displayPersonDetails()` — binds basic person information to labels.
- `displayCharts()` — populates all four performance charts.
- `createChartSeries()` — transforms raw statistics into chart data (package-private for testing).
- `configureAxes()` — configures X-axis bounds to show match numbers correctly.

---

#### CommandResult Enhancement

To enable modal window support, the `CommandResult` class was enhanced with additional fields and factory methods:

**Key Fields:**
- `showPersonDetail` (boolean) — indicates whether the person detail window should be shown.
- `personToShow` (Person) — the person whose details should be displayed (null if not applicable).

**Factory Method:**
- `CommandResult.showPersonDetail(String message, Person person)` — creates a result configured to open the person detail window. Used by `ViewCommand` to trigger the display.

**Integration with UI:**

The `MainWindow` class handles `CommandResult` objects returned by command execution:

1. **Check result flag**: After executing a command, `MainWindow` checks `isShowPersonDetail()`.
2. **Extract context data**: If the flag is set, it extracts the person using `getPersonToShow()`, which returns `Optional<Person>`.
3. **Create and show window**: It creates a `PersonDetailWindow` instance, passes the person data via `setPerson()`, and shows the window.

This design maintains **separation of concerns**: commands decide *what* to show, UI decides *how* to show it. Commands remain decoupled from JavaFX implementation details.

---

#### Sequence Diagram

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the `view` command interacts with the UI to display the person detail window:

<puml src="diagrams/ViewCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ViewCommandSequenceDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The diagram shows how `CommandResult` acts as the bridge between Logic and UI layers. The command creates a `CommandResult` with the person data, and `MainWindow` detects this and opens the `PersonDetailWindow` accordingly, maintaining separation of concerns.

</box>

---

#### Example Usage

**Step 1.**
The user views the person list and identifies a person they want detailed information about.

**Step 2.**
The user executes `view 1` to view the first person.
- `ViewCommandParser` parses the index argument using `ParserUtil.parseIndex()`.
- `ViewCommand` is created with the target index.

**Step 3.**
`ViewCommand#execute()` validates the index and retrieves the person:
- Checks that the index is within bounds of the filtered person list.
- Retrieves the `Person` object at the specified index.
- Creates a `CommandResult` using the factory method `CommandResult.showPersonDetail()`, passing the person object.

**Step 4.**
`MainWindow` receives the `CommandResult`:
- Detects `isShowPersonDetail()` is true.
- Extracts the person using `getPersonToShow()`.
- Creates a new `PersonDetailWindow` and calls `setPerson(person)`.
- Shows the window with `show()`.

**Step 5.**
`PersonDetailWindow` displays the information:
- `setPerson()` triggers data population.
- Basic details are bound to labels via `displayPersonDetails()`.
- Charts are populated via `displayCharts()`, which creates data series for up to the latest 10 matches.
- The window appears centered on screen with all information visible.

---

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Modal window vs in-app panel**

- **Alternative 1 (current implementation):**
  Use a separate modal window to display person details.
    - *Pros:* Doesn't clutter the main UI. Users can keep the window open while working with the main app.
    - *Pros:* Allows multiple detail windows to be open simultaneously (future enhancement).
    - *Cons:* Window management (position, size) must be handled carefully.

- **Alternative 2:**
  Display details in a panel within the main window (e.g., sidebar or bottom panel).
    - *Pros:* No window management needed. Simpler implementation.
    - *Cons:* Takes up space in the main UI, reducing visibility of the person/team lists.
    - *Cons:* Can only view one person's details at a time.

**Aspect: Chart data range**

- **Alternative 1 (current implementation):**
  Show up to the latest 10 matches in performance charts.
    - *Pros:* Focuses on recent performance trends. Charts remain readable.
    - *Cons:* Older data is not visible in the charts (though still stored).

- **Alternative 2:**
  Show all matches in the charts.
    - *Pros:* Complete historical view.
    - *Cons:* Charts become cluttered for persons with many matches. Performance may degrade.

- **Alternative 3:**
  Allow users to configure the range (e.g., last 5, 10, 20 matches).
    - *Pros:* Flexible to user needs.
    - *Cons:* Adds UI complexity. Requires additional state management.

**Aspect: How to signal UI actions from commands**

- **Alternative 1 (current implementation):**
  Extend `CommandResult` with flags and optional data fields.
    - *Pros:* Centralized result handling. All commands return the same type.
    - *Pros:* UI layer handles all window management. Commands remain decoupled from JavaFX.
    - *Cons:* `CommandResult` class grows as more UI actions are added.

- **Alternative 2:**
  Use an event bus or observer pattern where commands emit events.
    - *Pros:* More extensible. New events can be added without modifying `CommandResult`.
    - *Cons:* Adds complexity. Requires event bus infrastructure.
    - *Cons:* Harder to trace control flow during debugging.

- **Alternative 3:**
  Commands directly call UI methods (e.g., `ui.showPersonDetail(person)`).
    - *Pros:* Simple and direct.
    - *Cons:* Violates layered architecture. Commands become tightly coupled to UI.
    - *Cons:* Makes testing commands difficult (need to mock UI).

### Ungrouping Teams Feature

#### Implementation

The team ungrouping feature is implemented through the `UngroupCommand` and `UngroupCommandParser` classes.
It allows users to disband one specific team or all teams at once, returning all team members to the unassigned pool.

When the user executes:

`ungroup INDEX` or `ungroup all`

the application removes the specified team(s) from the model, making all affected persons available for future team formation.

This functionality is supported by the following key components:

- **`UngroupCommand`** — represents the command that removes teams. Supports two modes: single team removal and remove all.
- **`UngroupCommandParser`** — parses the user input, distinguishing between an index and the "all" keyword (case-insensitive).
- **`Model#deleteTeam(Team)`** — removes a team from the model and triggers UI updates.
- **`Model#getFilteredTeamList()`** — retrieves the current list of teams being displayed.

---

#### Two Modes of Operation

`UngroupCommand` supports two distinct modes through constructor overloading:

1. **Single Team Removal**: `new UngroupCommand(Index targetIndex)`
   - Removes the team at the specified index in the displayed team list.
   - The `removeAll` flag is set to `false`.

2. **Remove All Teams**: `new UngroupCommand()`
   - Removes all teams from the model.
   - The `removeAll` flag is set to `true` and `targetIndex` is `null`.

This design follows the **Factory Pattern** concept where different constructors create objects with different behaviors.

---

#### Sequence Diagram

The following sequence diagram illustrates the execution of the `ungroup` command for removing a single team:

<puml src="diagrams/UngroupCommandSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UngroupCommandSequenceDiagram-Model" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The diagram shows the single team removal flow. For `ungroup all`, the flow is similar but `executeRemoveAll()` is called instead, which iterates through a defensive copy of the team list.

</box>

---

#### Example Usage Scenario 1: Remove Single Team

**Step 1.**
The user views the team list in the team panel and sees multiple teams.

**Step 2.**
The user executes `ungroup 2` to disband the second team.
- `UngroupCommandParser` parses "2" as an index using `ParserUtil.parseIndex()`.
- Creates `new UngroupCommand(Index.fromOneBased(2))`.

**Step 3.**
`UngroupCommand#execute()` validates and removes the team:
- Retrieves the filtered team list from the model.
- Validates the index is within bounds (throws `CommandException` if invalid).
- Calls `executeRemoveSingle()` helper method.
- Gets the team at the specified index.
- Calls `model.deleteTeam(team)` to remove it.
- Returns a success message showing which team was removed.

---

#### Example Usage Scenario 2: Remove All Teams

**Step 1.**
The user has multiple teams and wants to reset and start over.

**Step 2.**
The user executes `ungroup all`.
- `UngroupCommandParser` detects the "all" keyword (case-insensitive check).
- Creates `new UngroupCommand()` (no-argument constructor).

**Step 3.**
`UngroupCommand#execute()` removes all teams:
- Validates that there are teams to remove (throws `CommandException` if none).
- Calls `executeRemoveAll()` helper method.
- Creates a defensive copy of the team list using `List.copyOf()` to avoid concurrent modification.
- Iterates through the copy and calls `model.deleteTeam(team)` for each team.
- Returns a success message showing how many teams were removed.

---

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Single command vs separate commands**

- **Alternative 1 (current implementation):**
  Use one `UngroupCommand` that supports both single and all removal via constructor overloading.
    - *Pros:* User-friendly with intuitive syntax (`ungroup 1` vs `ungroup all`).
    - *Pros:* Reduces code duplication. Both modes share validation logic.
    - *Cons:* Command class handles two distinct behaviors, slightly violating Single Responsibility Principle.

- **Alternative 2:**
  Create separate commands: `UngroupCommand` for single removal and `UngroupAllCommand` for removing all.
    - *Pros:* Stricter adherence to Single Responsibility Principle.
    - *Cons:* More classes to maintain. Introduces code duplication for shared logic.
    - *Cons:* Requires separate command words (e.g., `ungroup` and `ungroupall`), less intuitive for users.

**Aspect: Handling concurrent modification**

- **Alternative 1 (current implementation):**
  Create a defensive copy of the team list before iteration using `List.copyOf()`.
    - *Pros:* Safe and prevents `ConcurrentModificationException`.
    - *Pros:* Simple and clear code.
    - *Cons:* Minor memory overhead for copying the list.

- **Alternative 2:**
  Use an iterator with explicit removal.
    - *Pros:* No memory overhead for copying.
    - *Cons:* More complex code. Easy to introduce bugs.

- **Alternative 3:**
  Collect team IDs first, then remove by ID.
    - *Pros:* Avoids concurrent modification.
    - *Cons:* Requires additional ID lookup logic. More complex.

### Data Import / Export Feature
The **Import/Export** feature enables users to back up, share, and restore player and team data in CSV format.  
It enhances data portability, supports external analysis and allows synchronisation across different SummonersBook instances.

#### Implementation

This feature is implemented through two primary command classes:

| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ExportCommand` | Exports player or team data into a structured CSV file. |
| `ImportCommand` | Imports player data from a CSV file. |

Both commands delegate CSV parsing and file I/O handling to utility classes within the `storage` package.

#### Export Workflow

1. The user executes `export players`/`export players to CUSTOM_PATH`/`export teams`/`export teams to CUSTOM_PATH`.
2. The command validates:
   - That the target (`players` or `teams`) is specified.
   - That the custom file path (if provided) ends with `.csv`.
3. Determines the output destination:
   - Default paths:
     - `data/players.csv`
     - `data/teams.csv`
   - Custom path
4. Retrieves relevant data from the `Model`.
5. Converts objects into CSV format and writes them to the file.
6. Returns a success message with the destination path.

**Example Output**
`Exported players to data/players.csv`

##### CSV Schema

| Data Type | Columns |
|------------|----------|
| Player | `Name,Role,Rank,Champion,Wins,Losses` |
| Team | `TeamId,Top,Jungle,Mid,Adc,Support,Wins,Losses,WinRate%` |


#### Import Workflow

1. The user executes `import players from FILE_PATH`.
2. The command validates that:
   - The file exists.
   - The file extension is `.csv`.
3. Parses the header row to detect supported formats:
   - Basic: `Name,Role,Rank,Champion`
   - Extended: `Name,Role,Rank,Champion,Wins,Losses`
4. For each row:
   - Validates **Role** and **Rank** (must match defined enums).
   - Skips **duplicate** entries (same Name + Role combination).
   - Skips **invalid** entries (unrecognized enums, missing columns, or malformed data).
   - Logs skipped rows for debugging.
   - Constructs `Person` objects for valid rows and adds them to the `Model`.
5. Displays a summary message after completion.

**Example Output**
`Imported 10 players, skipped 1 duplicate, 2 invalid row(s).`

#### Design Considerations

| Aspect | Alternatives | Decision / Rationale |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| **File Format** | 1. CSV (✓ chosen)  <br> 2. JSON | CSV is lightweight, human-readable, and compatible with spreadsheet tools. |
| **Error Handling** | 1. Skip invalid rows (✓ chosen) <br> 2. Abort on first error | Skipping invalid rows ensures partial progress and robustness against formatting issues. |
| **Validation** | Validate enums for `Role` and `Rank`. | Prevents injection of invalid or malformed data into the system model. |
| **File Location** | 1. Default `/data/` directory (✓ chosen) <br> 2. Custom paths | Offers both consistency and flexibility for users. |
| **Round-Trip Accuracy** | N/A | Exported player CSVs can be re-imported to yield identical data, ensuring lossless serialization. |


#### Example Workflows

**Export players → Import players**
> export players
`Exported players to data/players.csv`

> import players from data/players.csv
`Imported 20 players, skipped 0 duplicates, 0 invalid row(s).

**Export teams to custom path`**
> export teams to data/myTeams.csv
`Exported teams to data/myTeams.csv`

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be
   able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. Data entered by the user should be **saved automatically** and persist between sessions.
5. The system should handle invalid input gracefully by showing an error message without crashing.
6. System should be secure against unintended file modifications (i.e., only application data files are read/written).

### Glossary

*   **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
*   **Champion**: A unique playable character with a distinct set of abilities, like a hero in a fantasy story. A player's primary Champion represents their specialization. Game rules prohibit duplicate Champions on a team, making this a key constraint in SummonersBook.

*   **Role**: A player's designated position and responsibility on the team. A valid team requires one player for each of the five standard roles: **Top, Jungle, Mid, ADC (Attack Damage Carry), and Support**.

*   **Rank**: A tier representing a player's skill level, similar to a chess rating (e.g., Gold, Diamond). It is the primary attribute used by SummonersBook to create balanced teams.

*   **Unassigned Person**: A player in the system who is not on a team and is available for team creation; effectively a "free agent."

*   **Performance Statistics (Stats)**: Metrics that quantify a player's performance in a match.
    *   **CPM (CS per Minute)**: A measure of a player's efficiency at earning in-game gold.
    *   **GD@15 (Gold Difference at 15 minutes)**: A player's gold lead or deficit against their direct opponent at the 15-minute mark.
    *   **KDA (Kills/Deaths/Assists Ratio)**: A ratio `(Kills + Assists) / Deaths` indicating combat effectiveness.

*   **Scrim**: An organized practice match between two teams, used to test strategies and evaluate players.

*   **Rank-Ordered Team**: A team automatically created by the `group` command. It is formed by selecting the highest-ranked available players for each of the five required roles, while ensuring no duplicate champions. The algorithm selects the highest-ranked available player for each role when forming teams, meaning Team 1 will contain the highest-ranked players, Team 2 will contain the next-highest-ranked players, and so on. This process creates balanced, tiered teams (Team 1 > Team 2, etc.).
